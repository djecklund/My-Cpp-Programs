# My-Cpp-Programs
 This repository contains the C++ Programs I've built. 

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>SimpleCalculatorProject</b> - Starter project for me. I have just recently started learning C++. Used Eclipse IDE.</li>
<li><b>FlipACoin</b> - This program takes in a user's input for the number of times to flip a coin. A class called FlipACoin then uses functions to randomly flip the coin however many times the user specifies. There is a calculation that displays the number of times the coin landed on heads and tails. Lastly, everything is averaged to show what percentage of the time the coin landed on heads or tails.</li>
</ol>
